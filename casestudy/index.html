    <h3> The Overview </h3>
    <h4>Tasked to build microinteractions onto a feature on a pre-existing website,  
        I chose to redesign a category selector card on 
        Unity’s website. It is a card with an image, a title and description, and a link that
        leads to a page with the services Unity offers 
        regarding that category. At the time of research, the existing card 
        had no interaction changes happening on it besides a cursor change. My vision for
         enhancing it was to add more movement and color when hovering and clicking different elements.

    <h3> Context & Challenge </h3>
    <h4>
        Unity has many dynamic and lively microinteractions, reflecting on its services as 
        a graphics development platform, but I was surprised to find a set of cards linking to different pages 
        not having any other interactions on them at all. At the time of discovery, the Industry 
        Category card would not show any changes when hovered or clicked upon 
        besides a cursor-to-pointer change. To improve this, I decided to elevate the existing 
        feature (while using the same content and layout) by adding new microinteractions to it 
        – including a drop shadow appearing when hovering on the entire card, color changes and 
        animations when hovering on the text link, and a zoom effect and simple blue line animation 
        when hovering on the image. 

        This would be a project that I would develop on my own, and I had begun by 
        visualizing what I wanted the microinteration to look like prior to building it.

    <h3> Process & Insight</h3>
    <h4>
        Creating the final microinteraction build was truly a step by step journey. Early on in the 
        process, I knew I wanted to retain the original interaction’s style, colors, content, and 
        layout. After they were replicated through HTML and CSS, I had to arrange what kind of 
        microinteractions I would add to the build to enhance it. Though I had some initial ideas, 
        making it have multiple interactions and be more dynamic did pose a challenge. 
    </h4>

    <h4>
        I started out small by compiling images and editing them to depict what I wanted to program – 
        this included 
        a hover effect on the image that would make it zoom in, a hover effect on the entire card that 
        would change the color of the drop shadow from blue to dark gray, and a hover effect on the 
        link where it would turn a lighter blue and an underline would animate from left to right 
        underneath the text. 
    </h4>

    <h4>
        Unity is a website for people who are learning and applying digital 
        graphics (in video games, architecture design, etc.) and the user base is comprised of young 
        adults to middle aged adults who are well-versed with digital products. To me this meant that 
        I could add more flashy elements that were attractive and engaging without being too much for 
        the user to apprehend. 
    </h4>

    </div>

    <h3> The Solution </h3>
    <h4>
        I decided to have a motif of a blue animated line (one when hovering on the link and one that 
        appears when hovering on the image) moving from left to right to encourage acting upon it, as 
        well as to match Unity’s color scheme to be more cohesive. These hover animations were one key 
        component of the build. Another main feature was that the image would enlarge in its container 
        when hovered upon. The last main interaction was of the entire card itself; on its own it has 
        a drop shadow that’s gray, when hovered on the shadow turns blue, and when clicked the shadow 
        becomes a dark gray. Additionally when clicked on, the entire card expands in its place.

    <h3> The Results</h3>
    <h4>
        It was enjoyable to retain the website’s original feature and to work on microinteractions to 
        enhance it. I aimed to make it have more movement and color and I feel the final build reflects 
        just that. Something that I would keep in mind for the future would be planning out the process 
        beforehand and having a clear vision of what I want the microinteraction to be. This would help 
        me create a more coherent and cohesive product, ensuring that the microinteraction is easy to 
        understand for its intended users and that it is consistent with the rest of the website.
